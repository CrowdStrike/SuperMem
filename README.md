# Troubleshooting
There are a number of known bugs, which are outlined in this section.
- Dumping files may not work on Windows images below Windows8. The offset supplied by the volatility3 filescan plugin is sometimes physical and not virtual. There is not a descriptor specifying which is returned either. The current script is expecting virtual only. You can fix this by changing the dumpfiles function from `--virtaddr` to `--physaddr`.
